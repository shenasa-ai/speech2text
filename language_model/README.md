# Create language model 

in this folder I will share what we did to create our language model.

## text cleaning
all the text corpuses are dirty and need preprocess. to clean your txt files (for persian) use clean_text.py

to clean your csv format texts. check clean_csv.py file

TIP : the script may not be  with your txt or csv file. just a little edit may help you. BUT THE IS TESTED AND WILL WORK AT LAST. 

### Run the text_cleaning code ⚙️
to run clean_csv and clean_txt python files. make sure the address to your csv or txt file is right.


## make final csv

this python file is really dependent to my own files. read the code and if it is usefull for you use it.


TIP : you may see many parts are commented. they are all sequential steps to create your final csv files. all the codes are usefull and if they are comment it doesn't mean they are useless.

### Run the make final csv code ⚙️
just make sure the address to csv and tsv files are right.
